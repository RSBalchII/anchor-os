# Documentation Policy & Truth Source
1. **Source of Truth:** The `README.md`, `specs/` directory, `tasks.md`, and `plan.md` are the ONLY sources of truth.
2. **Source of History:** The `specs/standards/` directory contains the immutable project history and decisions.
3. **Code Authority:** Code must align with the specs. If code diverges, update the spec first.
